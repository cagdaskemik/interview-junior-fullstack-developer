## Submission of Task for Junior Full-Stack Developer Position
Dear Erento Team,

Thank you again for this opportunity! I'm excited to present my completed solution for the task you provided. I've included multiple options for displaying on Angular, and carried the functionality over to Nest.js. I've written some sample tests too!

I hope you like the outline. Since the functionality requirements were somewhat vague, I took the liberty of implementing multiple ways to list the results.

I tried to use as few packages as possible, as it was not specified. I used CSS instead of Tailwind to keep the project simple.

Thank you for the opportunity!
