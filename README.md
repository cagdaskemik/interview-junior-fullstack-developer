## Submission of Task for Junior Full-Stack Developer Position
Dear Erento Team,

I'm excited to present my completed solution for the task you provided. I've included multiple options for displaying, and also carried the functionality over to backend. I've written some sample tests too!

I hope you like the outline. Since the functionality requirements were somewhat vague, I took the liberty of implementing multiple ways to list the results.

I tried to use as few packages as possible, as it was not specified. I used CSS instead of Tailwind to keep the project simple.

Thank you again for the opportunity!
